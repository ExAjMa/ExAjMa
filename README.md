- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Manisha
I am a QA by profession.  
In the long walk of software quality testing services when my responsibility was to observe and evaluate the performance of the software I was testing, now the practice has got embedded deep within my mindset.
Learning behavior and patterns has become a hobby that I am planning to pursue further in my next milestone - Data Analysis.
I have taken courses on Business Intelligence tools and have done some POCs to evolve better in the journey of data analysis.
Somewhere the attribute touches the personal aura as well pushing me to read the surroundings first. It drives me to be a people's person with an ease of access. I find myself to be quite approachable by the people in my near and far proximity.
They look forward to me for support, to answer their queries, to solve their confusion....! And that brings my best trait - A storyteller.
I am an engaging storyteller. Stories that sometimes come from within, sometimes from experience, and at times it's just picked from somewhere.
I find stories as the best medium to connect and to communicate where one can convey the messages in easy language.

- :laughing:  Fun fact -  That's why Agile is so popular because it has large project objectives split into short, crisp and achievable user stories.
